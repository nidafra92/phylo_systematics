# phylo_systematics repo

## Description
This repository is for the code I've written for Phylogenetic Systematics course.

* [**evo-model-select.py:**](evo-model-select.py) is a script for substitution model selection using likelihood values computed by Garli given a FASTA alignment and a model list.
